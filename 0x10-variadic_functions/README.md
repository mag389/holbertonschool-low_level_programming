The readme file for the variadic functions project, includes three mandatory tasks in regards to variadic funcitons.

A Variadic function is one which can take any number of arguments, rather than a preset number of arguments of certain types.  In the C language this is mostly done through the stdarg.h library and the macros included iwthin that library.
