#Singly linked lists
##Read me for singly linked lists project directory.  
This project deals with the creation and application of singly linked lists.  A isnlgy linked list is a data structured made up of nodes, each of which contains value information and a pointer to the next node.
The head of a linked list is the first node, likewise the tail is the last node, which has a NULL pointer instead of pointing to another node.
As opposed to doubly linked lists singly linked lists can only be traversed forward, not backwards.
